### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Currently , everything we do revolves around some sort of data visualizing and management and I find that intriguing. And as such I took it upon myself to seek further education and hands-on training in the field of Data Science.

:bar_chart: Currently, I am increasing my experience and contributing to data analysis and data engineering projects, trying to use SQL and Tableau extensively. Also actively looking into other fields that revolve around data and such!

:gear: I have graduated from Bloomtech's data science program! 

:mag_right: Key focus areas:

Data Wrangling, Statistical Analysis, and dabbled into Linear Algebra
Explored different Linear Models and various Data Visualizations
Worked mostly in SQL, touching Tableau a bit
Delved into NLP and Neural Networks briefly


I am always looking for new opportunities and enjoy collaborating with like-minded individuals on projects that provide insight to facilitate informed decision making and valuable solutions. And for any recruiters, I highly implore you to take a chance. Don't let the fact that just because I do not have a degree does not mean I cannot learn and adapt as well as someone who does have one would.
