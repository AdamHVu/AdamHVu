### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Everything we do nowadays revolves around some sort of data visualizing and management and I find that intriguing. And as such, I took it upon myself to seek further education and hands-on training in the field of Data Science.
:bar_chart: Currently, I am furthering my experience and contributing to machine learning and data engineering projects.
:gear: I am working on achieving my certification from graduating BloomTechâ€™s data science and machine learning program.
:mag_right: Key focus areas:
Data Wrangling, Statistical Analysis, and dabbled into Linear Algebra
Explored different Linear Models and various Data Visualizations
Worked mostly in SQL and have touched upon a few other databases
Delved into NLP and Neural Networks
I am always looking for new opportunities and enjoy collaborating with like-minded individuals on projects that provide insight to facilitate informed decision making and valuable solutions.
