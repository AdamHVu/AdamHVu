### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Everything we do nowadays revolves around some sort of data visualizing and management and I find that intriguing. And as such, I took it upon myself to seek further education and hands-on training in the field of Data Science.

:bar_chart: Currently, I am furthering my experience and contributing to data analysis and data engineering projects, trying to use SQL and Python extensively. Also actively looking into other fields like Business and Crypto!

:gear: I have graduated from Bloomtech's data science program! 

:mag_right: Key focus areas:

Data Wrangling, Statistical Analysis, and dabbled into Linear Algebra
Explored different Linear Models and various Data Visualizations
Worked mostly in SQL and have touched upon a few other databases
Delved into NLP and Neural Networks albeit briefly


I am always looking for new opportunities and enjoy collaborating with like-minded individuals on projects that provide insight to facilitate informed decision making and valuable solutions. And for any recruiters, I implore you to take a chance. Don't let the fact that just because I do not have a degree does not mean I cannot learn and adapt as well as someone who does have one would.
