### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Most people say that in high school, they coded and build programs and websites. I could not say the same at least in my case mostly because I never really investigate that matter early on. I was always a gamer at heart and as such while never really finishing anything major, I always dabbled in game creation on a smaller scale.
Once a kid in high school with no direction other than a general interest in anything tech to working retail a while mostly to work on customer interaction and communication skills, I have found a path that I want to take. That being Data Science. Why? Simple enough, the way the world is headed, everything we do revolves around some sort of data visualizing and management and I find that intriguing. And as such, I took it upon myself to seek further education. Personally I do not like colleges as I feel that the general courses they provide no actual value so I searched further. I landed myself at Bloomtech because they provided projects that relate to the real job field and a modern curriculum that should be more than sufficient! 

I am currently a BloomTech Student studying up to become a Data Analyst / Scientist. 
Subjects of study have included:
  - Data Wrangling, Statistical Analysis, and dabbled into Linear Algebra
  - Explored different Linear Models and various Data Visualizations
  - Worked mostly in SQL and have touched upon a few other databases
  - Delved into NLP and Neural Networks
I am always looking for more avenues of knowledge and advice for anything to enable further learning!
