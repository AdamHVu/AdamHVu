### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am currently a BloomTech Student studying up to become a Data Analyst / Scientist. 
Subjects of study have included:
  - Data Wrangling, Statistical Analysis, and dabbled into Linear Algebra
  - Explored different Linear Models and various Data Visualizations
  - Worked mostly in SQL and have touched upon a few other databases
  - Delved into NLP and Neural Networks
I am always looking for more avenues of knowledge and advice for anything to enable further learning!
